## Introduction

Create a Playwright-driven test suite that leverages data-driven techniques to minimize code duplication and improve scalability. By driving test scenarios from a JSON object, we can dynamically adapt each test case without repeating code, ensuring a clean and maintainable structure as new cases are added.

## Implementation Details

### TypeScript types and interfaces

There is a hierarchy of AsanaBoard -> AsanaSwimlane -> AsanaStory and corresponding types that add testing-specific data.

```typescript
export interface AsanaStory {
  title: string
  description: string
  tags: string[]
}

export interface AsanaSwimlane {
  order: number
  kind: ASANA_SWIMLANE_KIND
  stories: AsanaStory[]
}

export type AsanaStoryTestData = AsanaStory & { included: boolean }
export type AsanaSwimlaneTestData = Omit<AsanaSwimlane, 'stories'> & {
  stories: AsanaStoryTestData[]
}
```

### Data-Driven Testing

All test data comes from `test-data.ts` which implements the tests described in the [requirements document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oGwPbnNImNIlEkwdMcBCUhgQEPclkDss8iFZP2A8AQ0/edit?tab=t.0). This data in turn drives which tests are perfomed using the type system described above.

### DOM Parsing: `getSwimlanes` function

There is a single DOM-parsing function that retrieves the Swimlanes from the given page. This is heavy on specific selectors ATM, but, we need to infer relationships between tasks and swimlanes to ensure:

- Each test is preformed on the correct swimlane
- That tests for the existence of things are carried out only on relevant portions of the DOM. E.g., we need to check for both for "Design" as a tag and "Design system updates" as a task title.

## Challenges and Solutions

The key challenge in testing this code is isolating discreet sections of the DOM to ensure we are checking for elements/strings in the right place.

While it is a best-practice to test only [user-visible behavior](https://playwright.dev/docs/best-practices#test-user-visible-behavior), achieving this required some DOM parsing. To isolate this as much as possible I wrote a `getSwimlanes` helper function that uses very basic selectors that is run before each test. If there is a change in the DOM of the target page, this will at least break cleanly and in a way that is easy to fix.

## Recommendations

Retrospectively, I could have done a better job separating the JSON test data from the implementation. There should have been a separate JSON file which would have both made it easier to maintain the test suite and to potentially generate new test suites for JSON files generated by a tool.

I would consider adding the [Asana TypeScript types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/asana) to improve the `getSwimlanes` function because doing so _might_ make it easier to parse the Asana data and it is reasonable to assume I think that all Asana instances will implement the official Asana types.

The downside is that it creates a [third-party dependency](https://playwright.dev/docs/best-practices#avoid-testing-third-party-dependencies), which is why I chose to create very simple types that describe the how Boards/Swimlanes/Stories/Tags are related in the presentation layer.
